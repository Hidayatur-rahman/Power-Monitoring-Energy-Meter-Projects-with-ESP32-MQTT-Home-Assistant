Author : Hidayatur rahman
# Introduction
This my first documented Arduino IoT project is both exciting and challenging. I'll be building A Smart Power meter using an ESP32, Pzem for data collection, MQTT for communication, and Home Assistant for visualization. This project will help understand core IoT concepts like sensor data collection, wireless connectivity, and real-time monitoring.
# Prototyping Implementaion
